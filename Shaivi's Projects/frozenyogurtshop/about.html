					<h1>Introduction:</h1>
					<p>Hi, my name is Shaivi Shah and at this website I'm going post recipes of ice cream, sorbets, frozen yougurt plus more frozen treats. I am going to start with only recipes of frozen desserts but in the future I hope to expand to tasty main courses and baked goods. Most of my ice cream recipe will be no machine ice cream which means you don't have to use an ice cream machine. From my recent trip to europe I visited Italy where I tried their famous gelato. I will recreate those authentic flavors and share the recipe to you so you can get a feel of Italy too. My website's name is Amarena which comes from my favorite gelato flavor that I tried in Italy and I wish to make that flavor one day.   </p>
					<h1>Meet Shaivi:</h1>
					<p>I developed a passion for cooking and baking when I was 10 and I thought that I should put my skills to use. So I started this website where I could share magnificent recipes of many frozen desserts. My goal for this website is that for all of you ice cream lovers to recreate store bought ice cream. Especially when it's summer!. This site will gide you step by step through the ice cream making journey.</p>
